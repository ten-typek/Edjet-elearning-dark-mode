# DARK MODE FOR EDJET E-LEARNING 

Brings dark theme to e-learning systems by Edjet. I made this especially for my school (SOŠ Čelákovice), but it will work in other environments based on this system as well.  

## HOW TO USE

1. Install [Stylish](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) to your favorite browser 
2. Copy the code (i.e content of E-learning.css) 
3. Add new CSS for domain name of your e-learning system and paste the CSS code 
4. Voilá! Enjoy 

## KNOWN PROBLEMS 

- Not all types of questions are modified to match the dark scheme
- Login page needs more polishment 
- Due to difference of domains (institucions) that are using system by Edjet, this style can't be installed as user CSS
